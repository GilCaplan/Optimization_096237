# Non Linear Optimization

Continuous optimization is branch in the field of mathematical optimization that focuses on 
optimization models having continuous elements. It is one of the cornerstones of 
contemporary science and engineering, providing tools and methodology to model systems 
and tasks, optimize them, and analyze them. 
Introductory-level course in nonlinear continuous optimization emphasizing on convex optimization.

**Objectives**

 - Modeling: Recognize convex optimization problems, and model real-world problems 
as convex optimization problems. 
 - Solving: Use basic optimization algorithms and CVXPY as an off-the-shelf solver to 
solve optimization problems. 
 -  Analyzing: Understand and analyze the performance of basic algorithms for solving 
(un)constrained optimization problems. 
 - Developing: Gain basic understanding in the theory of convex optimization and use it 
to develop new optimization algorithms.
